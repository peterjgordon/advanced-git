### This project is made up of 2 scripts:

1. create a directory structure in the ~/team/folders/{foldername}
within {foldername}, a file with {filename}. Contents cannot be empty but is up to you.
error handling - helpful messages. If folder and file already exists, cancel

2. takes a {#}, create {#} number of files. (They can't have the same name)
they can be wherever you want. Re-running the script overwrites the files, delete them all first each time.
The {#} the file is in the contents of the file.
